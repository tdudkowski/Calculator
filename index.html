    <main>
        <p>This is my first calculator written in JavaScript. It works fine now, but there's still some probality of
            errors hard to reproduce.</p>
        <p>Design is non sequential; that means user should write all his calculations, and later click <strong>[&nbsp;Calculate&nbsp;]</strong>
            button. Input after sanitation is shown on top strip as a "<em>Calculation done:</em>", and result on a
            main field. If there's not enough data in input error info is displayed on top strip.</p>

        <h3>Info</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dividing by zero is illegal, and not supported</li>
            <li>All division results, and final result are rounded to fifth position after the dot</li>
            <li>Only the last one operator is counted, except situation when the last one is minus, so...</li>
            <li>If the last one operator is minus, then next number is negative, and the previous one operator is
                counted, except situation when the minus is the only one, so...</li>
            <li>If the minus is the only one, this is just the minus, except the situation when that minus is before
                the first number, so...</li>
            <li>If the minus is the only one (or the last in a row) operator before the first number it changes sign of
                that number to negative. Simply.</li>
            <li>Dot is a decimal. All dots from the beginning of a number are removed, so <em>.1</em> is just a <em>1</em>
                not <em>0.1</em>, as one could expect. Only the first dot in a number is counted, the second one and
                all signs after it are deleted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ToDo</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Firefox cant into divs as a buttons, why?</li>
            <li>result is removed if operator is clicked, maybe it should be that way</li>
            <li>more operators, and functions</li>
            <li>nicer design</li>
        </ul>
