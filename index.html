        <p>This is my first calculator written in JavaScript. It works, but is still buggy, especially if many dots are
            in operation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dividing by zero is illegal, and not supported</li>
            <li>All division results are rounded to fifth position after the dot</li>
            <li>Only the last one operator is counted, except situation when the last one is minus, so...</li>
            <li>If the last one operator is minus, then next number is negative, and the previous one operator is
                counted, except situation when the minus is the only one, so...</li>
            <li>If the minus is the only one, this is just the minus.</li>
            <li>Dot is a decimal. All dots from the beginning of a number are removed, so <em>.1</em> is just a <em>1</em>
                not <em>0.1</em>, as one could expect. Only the first dot in a number is sounting, the second one and
                all signs after it are deleted.</li>
        </ul>
        <!--
                TODO
                dot problem, this is BIG
                result is removed if operator is added, maybe it should be that way
                remove zeros after division
